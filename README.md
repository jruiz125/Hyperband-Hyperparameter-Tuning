# Hyperband Hyperparameter Tuning for Universal Differential Equations

This repository implements the Hyperband algorithm for efficient hyperparameter optimization of Universal Differential Equations (UDEs). The implementation focuses on neural network-enhanced differential equations with applications to physics-informed machine learning.

The Lotka-Volterra problem solution, see the following figure bellow, was solved using: two hyperparameter tuning methodologies, Hyperband and Random Search; and manual approach method, made in the SciML example: Automatically Discover Missing Physics by Embedding Machine Learning into Differential Equations.

The obtained Neural Networks were used to perform predictions within the time interval of 5 to 8 seconds.

## Overview

The Hyperband algorithm provides an efficient method for hyperparameter optimization by adaptively allocating resources to promising configurations. This implementation contains two main approaches:

### 1. Working Implementation (`src/solvers/hypersolver.jl`) ✅

The `hypersolver.jl` file contains a **high-fidelity implementation** of the original Hyperband algorithm from Li et al. (2016). This implementation:

- **Faithful reproduction**: Directly follows Algorithm 1 from the reference paper with 9/10 fidelity score
- **Correct bracket ordering**: Iterates from s_max down to 0 as specified in the paper
- **Accurate resource calculations**: Implements proper budget allocation B = (s_max + 1)R and resource scaling
- **Proper successive halving**: Correctly selects top k configurations at each stage
- **Proven functionality**: Successfully optimizes UDE hyperparameters with significant performance improvements

### 2. Modular Package (`src/HyperbandSolver/`) ⚠️ (In Development)

The `HyperbandSolver.jl` package is currently **in development process** and does not work properly, although the core algorithm matches the pseudo-code from the reference paper. This modular approach aims for integration with Optimization.jl but adds complexity that introduces potential bugs.

## Lotka-Volterra Case Study

This repository demonstrates the Hyperband method through a comprehensive analysis of the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system, starting from the [SciML Book: Universal Differential Equations tutorial](https://book.sciml.ai/notes/15-Mixing_Differential_Equations_and_Neural_Networks_for_Physics-Informed_Learning/). The implementation includes:

- **Analysis file**: `src/solvers/hyperband_Lotka-Volterra.jl` - Contains the complete comparison between Hyperband and Random Search methods
- **Optimal model**: `src/solvers/hyperband_Lotka-Volterra_optimal9.jl` - Contains the best configuration found during hyperparameter tuning and final model training

### Configuration Space

The Lotka-Volterra example optimizes over a **5-dimensional hyperparameter space**:

| Parameter | Type | Range/Options | Description |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `hidden_dim` | Discrete | [16, 32, 64, 128] | Neural network hidden layer dimensions |
| `n_layers` | Integer | 2-5 | Number of hidden layers in the network |
| `activation` | Categorical | [tanh, relu, sigmoid] | Activation function for hidden layers |
| `learning_rate` | Continuous | 10^(-4) to 10^(-1) | Learning rate for optimization (log-uniform) |
| `solver` | Categorical | [Tsit5(), Vern7(), AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23())] | ODE solver method |

This configuration space represents **3,840 possible discrete combinations** (4 × 4 × 3 × [continuous] × 3), with the learning rate sampled continuously from the log-uniform distribution, resulting in an effectively infinite search space that demonstrates the power of Hyperband's adaptive resource allocation.

### Best Configuration Found

Hyperband optimization identified the following **optimal configuration**:

| Hyperparameter | Optimal Value | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `hidden_dim` | 32 | Hidden layer dimensions |
| `n_layers` | 5 | Number of hidden layers (6 total layers) |
| `activation` | tanh | Activation function |
| `learning_rate` | 0.00390 | Learning rate for ADAM optimizer |
| `solver` | Vern7() | 7th-order Verner ODE solver |

**Network Architecture**: 2 → 32 → 32 → 32 → 32 → 32 → 2 (197,282 parameters)

### Two-Stage Training Approach

The optimal configuration was trained using a **robust two-stage optimization strategy**:

#### Stage 1: ADAM Optimization
- **Optimizer**: ADAM with adaptive learning rates
- **Learning Rate**: 0.00390 (found by Hyperband)
- **Maximum Iterations**: 1,000 (Hyperband), 5,000 (Baseline)
- **Purpose**: Fast initial convergence and exploration
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Zygote.jl via QuadratureAdjoint
- **Sensealg**: ReverseDiffVJP for efficient gradient computation

#### Stage 2: L-BFGS Refinement
- **Optimizer**: L-BFGS with BackTracking line search
- **Line Search**: LineSearches.BackTracking() for robust step sizing
- **Maximum Iterations**: Up to 1,000
- **Purpose**: Fine-tuning and high-precision convergence
- **Initialization**: Uses ADAM result as starting point
- **Convergence**: Typically converges in fewer iterations due to better starting point

### Training Configuration Summary

| Method | Architecture | Activation | Learning Rate | ADAM Iters | L-BFGS Iters | Total Params |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Hyperband (Best)** | 2→32→32→32→32→32→2 | tanh | 0.00390 | 1,000 | up to 1,000 | 197,282 |
| Random Search | 2→32→32→2 | tanh | 0.000323 | 1,000 | up to 1,000 | 2,210 |
| Baseline (Manual) | 2→5→5→5→2 | RBF | 0.001 | 5,000 | up to 1,000 | 87 |
