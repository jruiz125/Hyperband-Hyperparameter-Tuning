Equation solved.

fsolve completed because the vector of function values is near zero
as measured by the value of the function tolerance, and
the problem appears regular as measured by the gradient.

=== CHECKING FOR SAVED DATASET ===
✓ Successfully retrieved saved DataSet_temp from MATLAB workspace
Generated DataSet size: (72, 211)
Number of saved trajectories: 72
Data points per trajectory: 211
Angular range covered: 0° to 360.0° (72 trajectories saved, last at 355.0°)
Save point was configured for iteration 72 (from a total of 73)
✓ Dataset information stored for final analysis

=== DATASET SAVE CHECK ===
DataSet exists with 73 trajectories
Expected save point: 72
Total planned trajectories: 72
CASE: Computation continued beyond save point (already saved at 72)
Skipping final save to preserve correct trajectory count
No save needed - data already saved correctly at iteration 72
