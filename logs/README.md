# Rod Solver Pipeline Logs - Complete REPL Output Capture

This directory contains execution logs from the Rod Solver Pipeline with **COMPLETE REPL OUTPUT** capture.

## Enhanced Logging System

The logging system now captures **EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER** that appears in the REPL during pipeline execution, providing a complete record for analysis and debugging.

## What Gets Captured

### **Complete Console Output**
- All Julia `println()` and `print()` statements
- MATLAB engine output and communications
- Error messages and stack traces
- Progress indicators and status updates
- Function return values and intermediate results

### **System Information**
- Configuration parameters
- Julia version and environment details
- Working directory and file paths
- Execution timestamps and durations

### **MATLAB Integration**
- Complete MATLAB workspace communications
- MATLAB function call outputs
- MATLAB error messages and warnings
- File save/load operations from MATLAB

## Log File Structure

Each log file contains:

1. **Header Section**
   ```
   ================================================================================
   ROD SOLVER PIPELINE LOG WITH COMPLETE REPL OUTPUT
   ================================================================================
   Log file: [path]
   Start time: [timestamp]
   Julia version: [version]
   Working directory: [path]
   ================================================================================
   CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
   ================================================================================
   [Complete configuration object]
   ================================================================================
   COMPLETE PIPELINE EXECUTION OUTPUT:
   ================================================================================
   ```

2. **Complete REPL Output**
   - **Exact replica** of everything shown in the console
   - No information loss or filtering
   - All formatting and special characters preserved
   - Real-time capture as execution proceeds

3. **Footer Section**
   ```
   ================================================================================
   PIPELINE EXECUTION COMPLETED
   End time: [timestamp]
   ================================================================================
   ```

## Benefits for Analysis

### **Debugging Advantages**
- **Complete Context**: See exactly what happened at each step
- **Error Analysis**: Full error messages with complete stack traces
- **MATLAB Debugging**: All MATLAB engine communications captured
- **Timing Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and performance issues

### **Reproducibility**
- **Exact Execution Record**: Complete history of what was executed
- **Configuration Tracking**: All parameters saved with results
- **Environment Details**: Julia version, working directory, timestamps

### **Batch Processing**
- **Multiple Runs**: Compare different configuration executions
- **Historical Analysis**: Track changes over time
- **Result Verification**: Confirm successful completion of long-running jobs

## No Information Loss

Unlike traditional logging systems that filter or summarize output, this system captures:
- **Everything**: No filtering or summarization
- **Real-time**: Output captured as it happens
- **Formatted**: All console formatting preserved
- **Complete**: Both stdout and stderr streams captured
